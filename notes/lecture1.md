# Quantum vs Classical Stacks

## The Quantum Stack

- framework relating different concepts of quantum computing - qubits, gates, quantum circuits, algorithms, applications

## Classical Stack

- phones, laptops, smart devices, tablets

**Classical Bits**

- a 0 or 1, binary, like a switch
- classical bits are pulses of electricity
    - 1s and 0s are physically the absence or presence of electricity
- example: each pixel of an image is represented by bits

**Classical Gates**

- Gates change bits
- convert input bits to output bits
- physically take electric pulses and modify them or keep them the same
- physically a transistor that converts inputs to output bits
- example: can use gates to fill all the 1's and 0s in an image to invert the colors
- example: hundreds of millions of gates in a computer

**Circuits**

- Sequences of gates work together to make circuits
- specific pathways that link together
- example: computer chips, used to implement complex algorithms

**Classical Algorithms and Protocols**

- agreed upon steps computers use to solve problems
- circuits complete these steps when we tell them what to do

**Applications**

- example: type kitten into google â‡’ get images of kittens

## Quantum Computing Stack (still under construction)

Ideally: (not yet though)

1. You want to simulate a molecule on a quantum computer
2. You provide input to a quantum computer
3. The quantum computer shows you the output

Ideas work in theory, but aren't possible practically on a large scale

**Qubits**

- fundamental unit of info on a quantum computer
- bits can only be a 0 or 1 but Qubits can be in a combination of these 2 states
- many different ways to make cubits, but it's not clear which is the best
    - this means that not all quantum computers are the same

**Quantum Gates and Measurement**

- manipulate qubits
- many ways to visualize gates

**Quantum Circuits**

- sequence of quantum gates
- quantum chip is a very complicated quantum circuit

**Quantum Algorithms and Protocols**

- quantum circuits implement quantum algorithms

#### Quantum Computing Landscape

* Big 3: Google AI quantum, Microsoft, IBM Q
* Startups: rigetti, OQC, ionq, d wave, etc.
