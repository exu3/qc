# Quantum Mechanics

(Quantum gates + measurements and qubits)

- study of motion and interaction between very small objects
    - bacteria, light, sugar molecule, atoms, nanometers
- quantum particles can be **light, molecules, or atoms**

Counter intuitive effects of quantum 

1. Discreteness
2. Superposition
3. Interference
4. Entanglement
5. Measurement

## Discreteness

- Energy - property that tells you how hot something might be or how fast it's moving/can move
    - energy is continuous
- The energy of light is related to its color
    - ROYGBIV (the closer the color of light is to violet, the higher its energy)
    - Blue light is bad for your eyes because it has more energy than red light and can damage retina cells
- Energy is Discrete
    - can only take certain allowed values, nothing in between
- Quantum Mechanics is discrete
    - certain speeds wouldn't be allowed so basically a car would not accelerate continuously but rather jump from speed to speed
- analagous to the Hydrogen Experiement
    - hydrogen can only take up certain energies so they are missing colors when whte light is shined
- Discreteness in Quantum Computing
    - we can use the discrete levles of quantum objects as 0 and 1 for computing

## Superposition

- superposition - being in a combination of states at the same time
- Schrodinger's Cat
    - cat in a box
    - poison inside the box that could open and kill the cat
    - without opening the box, can you tell if the cat is alive or dead

## Interference

- interference - 2 or more possibilities either add up or cancel out

## Entanglement

- when objects are entangled, one objects state depends on another object's state
- no matter how far apart

## Measurement

- objects behave randomly so it's hard to predict measurements
- the outcome of a quantum measurement is often random
- by measuring a quantum state, we can change it
- we can only predict where an electron is likely to be found, not where it is exactly
